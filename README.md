# OpenCv_SobelEdgeDetection
Sobel Edge detection is a widely used algorithm of edge detection in image processing.
It is best to convert the image from an RGB scale to a Grayscale when using Sobel detector.
This c# code first takes an image input and converts the same to grayscale. Canny edge detection algorithm is applied to grayscale image, followed by sobel detector.
Horizontal and vertical edge is detected seperately changing xorder and yorder.
